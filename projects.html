								<h2> <a href="https://github.com/ZaraFinds/Stack-Overflow-Survey-2020/blob/master/Stack Overflow 2020.ipynb" target="_blank"> Exploratory Data Analysis of Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020</a></h2>
								<p>I have done a lot of really interesting analysis in this project which I highly recommend taking a look at. This was a self-driven project. I found the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/?_ga=2.173465829.792824818.1622046375-812555200.1622046375" target="_blank"> Stack Overflow Developer survey </a> to be interesting and I was personally curious about the responses of the participants like their favorite social media platforms, the distribution of countries or the programming languages they have worked with. I mainly used Python’s Pandas library to work with this data. I love this library very much; it offers a lot of flexibility in researching and manipulating data. Paired with Matplotlib or Seaborn, this library can be a powerful tool to create very intuitive and informative visualizations.</p>
								
								<h2><a href="https://github.com/ZaraFinds/McDonald-s-Menu-Nutrition-Analysis/blob/master/McDonald's Menu.ipynb" target="_blank"> Analysis and Data Visualization of McDonald’s Menu Nutrition</a></h2>
								<p>I got this McDonald’s dataset from Kaggle and was curious to categorize them based on their nutrition value. Here’s a bar chart of different food categories based on their total fat amount. I have used Pandas, Matplotlib ans Seaborn among other libraries to conduct this analysis. Having the knowledge to analyze and understand these kinds of data makes me feel empowered and I’m only getting started.</p>
								

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/ZaraFinds/goodreads" target="_blank"> Design, Creation and Query of a Goodreads Database of Over 16000 Books</a></h2>
								<p>This SQL project was for one of my courses at school. I did everything from scratch. I obtained a dataset of Goodreads books, their authors, ratings, etc on Kaggle. Then I used Python’s Pandas to clean the dataset, remove unnecessary data, strip all the spaces and new lines, etc. Based on the final dataset that I wanted to use, I designed an Entity Relationship Diagram. I wrote a Python script to import the CSV file into a SQL database, and then I wrote queries to find the answers to my research questions. I had a lot of fun working on this project. All the files are uploaded onto my GitHub which include the dataset, the python script, python code for cleaning the dataset, the MySQL dump file and SQL queries.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Learning/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks-master/SalesAnalysis/SalesAnalysis.ipynb" target="_blank"> Sales Analysis</a></h2>
								<p>This was a practice project that I did on some electronics sales data. I answered questions like what was the best month for sales, what city had the best sales, which products were frequently sold together, which products sold the most, etc; questions and charts that can be meaningful and useful for a business.</p>
